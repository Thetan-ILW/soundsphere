# Overview Of The Snickers Method
## 📌 Overview 

The Snicker Boost Method is based on the idea that you improve the most when you push past your stamina limits or experience discomfort/pain during play. Most sessions should be push sessions.  
This method is built on over 5 years of experience in VSRG.  
> DISCLAIMER: TAKE BREAKS! Not taking breaks when you need them can lead to conditions like carpal tunnel

## 🥁 Step 1: Starting a Session
- Every session should begin with a warm-up.
- Warm-up doesn’t always need to be “easy” maps (97–99% acc).
- More effective: start with a stamina-draining map to “shock” your muscles awake.

Suggested Warm-up Styles:
- Jumpstream
- Handstream
- Chordjack (personal favorite)

→ Start with maps above your level to engage your muscles early.  
→ Goal: Shorten warm-up time from ~30 minutes to ~10 minutes.
________________

## 🔁 Step 2: During the Session
After warming up, you'll feel:
- Either “normal”
- Or “off”

________________

✅ If feeling normal:
- Stick with the same pattern you started with for a bit.
- Then gradually transition to other patterns.

Example Linear Pattern:  
Chordjack → More Chordjack → Stream → Jumpstream → Etc.  
> Don't switch patterns every map.  
________________

❌ If feeling off:
Usually means your fingers have lost their habitual movement.
Snicker Fix:
1. After a hard warm-up, play 2–3 easy maps (2–3 mins each).
2. Use the pattern you plan to train (e.g., jumpstream).
3. Keep BPM low enough to maintain 98–99% accuracy (osu!scoreV1).
4. Focus on mimicking the finger motion you used when feeling “normal.”

Once you feel “reconnected”, return to the push session.
________________

## 🔥 Step 2B: Pushing Yourself
Play maps that are:
- Hard to finish
- Stamina-draining
- Beyond your current level
- When Pushing, aim for 92% to 96% (osu!scoreV1)
- Don’t play maps that you can only mash on them (dont Mash)

> Real improvement happens when your muscles are exhausted.  

In short:  
**DESTROY YOURSELF**  
HOWEVER The discomfort/pain you feel shouldn’t cause or be from an injury.  
________________

## Step 3: Session Length & Recovery
- Long sessions ≠ Better sessions
- Recovery is the key to improvement

Recommended:
- 2 sessions of 1.3 hours each
- 2–3 hours of rest in between

This is better than 1 giant 3-hour session.  
→ Muscles recover, adapt, and rebuild during breaks.
________________

## 💪 Step 4: Taking Care of Your Body
To perform your best:
- Prioritize rest
- Get proper sleep
- Eat well
- Exercise regularly

→ Getting sick = worse performance  
→ Eating before sessions might help boost performance.
________________

## 🤝 Bonus: Motivation & Friends
- Motivation is key to long-term improvement and happiness.
- Having supportive friends boosts motivation and keeps sessions fun.

## 📝 Notes
- This method is not absolute truth, like the title says ITS a methodology based on some ideas.
- Some players follow parts of this method.

Examples: Jibrank, Carretah, sav

If you're a beginner, just play more.  
Don’t push too hard yet—focus on learning to read patterns.  
After that, the Snicker Method becomes more effective.
